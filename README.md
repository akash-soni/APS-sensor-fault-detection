# APS-sensor-fault-detection
APS (Air Pressure System) is a prevention maintainence system which slows down a heavy duty vehicle using compressed air which force piston to provide pressure to brake pads in case of failure of component associated with APS.

The task here is to predict whether the failure was caused due to of component associated with APS or other components so that effeciency of APS can be improved.
